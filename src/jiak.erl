%% @doc Jiak: Riak utilities, focused on JSON-encoded data.
%%
%%      Riak is meant is web-shaped, and one of the most useful
%%      interchange formats on the web is JSON.  The Jiak libraries
%%      are intended to provide a simple system for serving data from
%%      Riak in the JSON format.
%%
%%      Jiak objects take the shape of JSON objects of the form:
%%<pre>
%%      {
%%       "bucket":"foo",
%%       "key":"123",
%%       "object":{
%%                 "barField":"bar",
%%                 "bazField":42
%%                }
%%       "links":[
%%                ["quuxbucket","quuxkey","quuxtag"],
%%                ["abcbucket","abckey","qbctag"]
%%               ]
%%       "vclock":"opaque-riak-vclock",
%%       "lastmod":"Mon, 03 Aug 2009 18:49:42 GMT"
%%      }
%%</pre>
%%      Within Riak, these fields get broken into their appropriate
%%      places in riak_object, but using the Jiak interface,
%%      applications see only mochijson2-encoded objects.  An
%%      application can choose to either dig through the structure the
%%      Erlang pattern-match way, or by using the interface provided
%%      by the jiak_object module.
%%
%%      Access to these objects as JSON is provided to clients that
%%      can speak HTTP by way of the jiak_resource Webmachine resource
%%      module.  Clients can GET bucket schemas and key lists, as well
%%      as fetch and store objects.  Semantics about which fields are
%%      allowed/readable/editable/etc. are provided by user-defined
%%      Erlang modules named for the bucket of the object.  For an
%%      example of such a module, see {@link jiak_example}.
%%
%%      Further access is provided by means of 'link' mapreduce specs
%%      and jaywalker_resource.  To support each of these, you should
%%      open a jiak_client, then call set_bucket/2 with your bucket
%%      name and the result of default_jiak_bucket_props/0.  Without
%%      that setting, the mapreduce system won't know how to extract
%%      links for following.

    end.

%% @spec default_jiak_bucket_props() -> [bucket_prop()]
%% @doc Returns the default additional bucket parameters for Jiak
%%      buckets, suitable for the second parameter in a call to
%%      jiak_client:set_bucket/2.
%%      The only property is currently 'linkfun' which sets up
%%      the given bucket to support the {link, Bucket, Tag, Acc}
%%      mapreduce spec.

%%</li><li>create an object with most-recent version of each field,
%%           according to object's last-modified date - fields missing
%%           in newer versions will have their values taken from older
%%           versions
